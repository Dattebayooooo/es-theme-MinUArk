# Theme for the RGB30 based on ShaunInman's MinUI

**Jelos/Rocknix and ArkOS versions can be downloaded in the "releases" section.**

For a experience close to the original MinUI interface: 

- Set Transition Style to "Instant" and turn off carousel transitions (**ArkOS only**) in Start Menu > UI Settings.
- Set Gamelist View Style to "Basic" in Start Menu > UI Settings > Theme Configuration
- The theme is optimized for use screenshots for the "grid" view and boxart for the "detailed" view. You can have both images if you set the following options in the scraper:

	- **Image Source:** Screenshot
	- **Box source:** Box2D or Box3D
	- **Logo Source:** Wheel

  **Note:** Most of the themes use the first option as the image source to show boxart, so changing that to screenshot would cause that other themes showing a screenshot instead of boxart.

**Installation instructions:**

For loading screen copy loading.jpg file to roms/launchimages

For bootlogo copy the "Image" file to the BOOT partition of your SD1 card overwriting the existing one.

**Warning:** Changing the boot logo could cause a known bug that would cause the unit to reboot instead of shutting down. To solve this, you need to open the unit and disconnect the battery for at least 30 seconds.
